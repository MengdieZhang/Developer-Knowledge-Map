# Teamwork Essentials: Agile Ceremonies, Pull Requests

## Concept Overview

- **Agile Ceremonies**: Core meetings in Agile methodology that facilitate communication, planning, and feedback within teams.
    - **Daily Standup**: Quick check-in on progress, blockers, and plans.
    - **Sprint Planning**: Define and estimate the work for the upcoming sprint.
    - **Sprint Review**: Showcase completed work to stakeholders.
    - **Retrospective**: Reflect on the sprint to identify improvements.
- **Pull Requests (PRs)**: A method for submitting code changes for review before they are merged into a shared branch.

## Real-World Use

- **Standups** keep everyone aligned and help surface blockers early.
- **Planning/Grooming** ensures developers understand tasks and estimate efforts.
- **Retrospectives** are crucial for continuous improvement.
- **PRs** allow for peer review, catching bugs, and encouraging collaboration.

## Common Pitfalls & Tips

- Don’t let **standups** become long status reports — stay time-boxed.
- **Retrospectives** are most valuable when honest and action-oriented.
- A good PR:
    - Has a clear title and description.
    - Tags relevant issues or tickets.
    - Limits scope — one concern per PR.
    - Seeks feedback, not just approval.

## Interview Insights

- Expect questions like:
    - "What’s your role during sprint planning?"
    - "How do you handle PR feedback you don’t agree with?"
    - "How does your team run retrospectives?"
- Emphasize:
    - Communication and feedback culture.
    - Your ability to explain your code during reviews.

## Mini Scenario

> "You’re halfway through the sprint and realize your task will take twice as long. What do you do?"

🔍 You should:
- Raise this during standup or immediately to your team.
- Reassess scope with your product owner/scrum master.
- Possibly re-scope or split the story for transparency and delivery.

## Hands-on Prompt

> - Create a pull request that introduces a new helper function.
> - Add a meaningful title (e.g., `feat: add date formatter util`).
> - Write a description that includes:
    >   - What was added/changed
>   - Why it was needed
>   - Any tests or edge cases considered
> - Tag at least one reviewer and one related ticket/issue.
